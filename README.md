# COVID
There is more data on Covid virus than I am capable of managing or understanding. My aim is to keep it simple.  Please let me know if you see problems with this data. I am starting with a subset from Johns Hopkins. Obviously, I cannot address accuracy, though Johns Hopkins has some interesting work on likely errors.
